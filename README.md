Documentation
-------------
- [Technical Memento](https://www.odoo.com/files/memento/OpenERP_Technical_Memento_latest.pdf) (pdf) is a short reference, a little outdated, but that still can't be missed.
- [Current official documentation](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/8.0/) actively maintained by the R&D team.
- [New API Guidelines](http://odoo-new-api-guide-line.readthedocs.org/), by Nicolas Bessi, can provide additional insights not yet covered in the official docs.
- [v7.0 official documentation](https://doc.odoo.com/) can be oudated, but still usefull to cover blind spots in the latest docs.
- [Data Model Documentation](http://useopenerp.com/v8) with UML diagrams.
