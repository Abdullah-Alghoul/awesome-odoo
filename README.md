Documentation
-------------

- [Technical Memento](https://www.odoo.com/files/memento/OpenERP_Technical_Memento_latest.pdf) (pdf) is a short reference, a little outdated, but that still can't be missed.
- [Current official documentation](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/8.0/) actively maintained by the R&D team.
- [New API Guidelines](http://odoo-new-api-guide-line.readthedocs.org/), by Nicolas Bessi, can provide additional insights not yet covered in the official docs.
- [Data Model Documentation](http://useopenerp.com/v8) with UML diagrams.

Documentation for older version can sometimes fill a few gaps in the latest docs:
- [v7.0 official documentation](https://doc.odoo.com/)
- [v6 developer documentation](http://openerp-server.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)

Tools
-----
- [Mandibule](https://bitbucket.org/mandibule/mandibule), an Odoo Model browser ([doc](http://mandibule.bitbucket.org/)).
- [ERPPeek](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ERPpeek) provides both a fully featured low-level API, and an encapsulation of the methods on Active Record objects, plus helpers to administrate the server remotely ([docs](http://erppeek.readthedocs.org)).
- [OERPlib](https://github.com/osiell/oerplib) is a Python RPC library which aims to provide an easy way to remotely pilot and manage an OpenERP server ([docs](http://pythonhosted.org/OERPLib/)).
